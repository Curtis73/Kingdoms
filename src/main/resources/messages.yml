Command_Info_Page1Title: '&aContents'
Command_Info_Page2Title: '&aWhat is Kingdoms?'
Command_Info_Page2Content1: Kingdoms is a plugin similar to the popular Factions plugin, but with changes to the gameplay. It allows a player to create his own Kingdom, protect land with the kingdom, and invade other's land for items (and for fun). To see all commands, do /k.
Command_Info_Page3Title: '&aStarting'
Command_Info_Page3Content1: First off, you would want to find a good place to build a base, a normal minecraft base. Once you find a nice spot, do /k create [kingdomname] to start your own kingdom. Then, do /k claim to claim the land you are standing on.
Command_Info_Page3Content2: Kingdoms claims chunks. Chunks are 16x255x16 groups of blocks in a minecraft world. So a chunk has the height of a world, and the width and breadth of 16 blocks.
Command_Info_Page3Content3: This chunk claimed by your kingdom can only be edited by you and your kingdom members, so this means non-members can't break, place or interact with the things in your land. Beware of tnt cannons and invasions though
Command_Info_Page3Content4: 'You don''t necessarily have to create your own kingdom. You can ask another kingdom mod or king to invite you to their kingdom, then you can join their kingdoms instead. '
Command_Info_Page3Content5: /k claim costs %claimcost% resource points
Command_Info_Page4Title: '&aThe Nexus'
Command_Info_Page4Content1: Once you have claimed your land, do /k nexus to place your nexus block, which resembles a beacon.
Command_Info_Page4Content2: Nexuses can't be broken with your hand, and can be used to access upgrades, gain resource points, or buy turrets. The nexus is your kingdom's base of operations. When broken by enemies, the enemies can steal your resource points, and if the land your nexus is on is sucessfully invaded, the items stored in the nexus, and all your kingdom resource points will go to the invading kingdom. So ALWAYS protect your nexus land, and the nexus itself.
Command_Info_Page4Content3: How to get resourcepoints? First off, do /k tradable. In that list, is the list of items you can't trade for resource points, and the items that give more resourcepoints when traded. To trade resource points, right-click your nexus, and click the wheat. You will now see an empty GUI to place items in. Every %itemrp% item(s) you place in the GUI, you earn 1 resource point. Close the GUI to confirm
Command_Info_Page5Title: '&aChampions and Invading'
Command_Info_Page5Content1: Now this is where the real difference between Kingdoms and Factions shows. You are able to invade others land (and vice versa) to claim their land to plunder their resources, build in that space, or just to vent your anger at a guy who deserves it.
Command_Info_Page5Content2: To invade someone's land, do /k invade while standing on it. By doing so, you summon their kingdom's champion. You will need to kill the champion in order to claim the land. If the champion kills you, you don't gain the land, and you die. The strength of a kingdom's champion depends on its upgrades.
Command_Info_Page5Content3: You can access champion upgrades through the nexus. It is recommended to upgrade Drag, Mock and Champion Speed first as they are the more effective upgrades for your champion. This does not mean that those are the only upgrades you need.
Command_Info_Page5Content4: If you happen to invade some other kingdom's nexus land, you will duel a stronger version of their kingom's champion. This nexus champion can summon nexus guards and has more health
Command_Info_Page5Content5: Invasions cost %invadecost% resource points each.
Command_Info_Page6Title: '&aTurrets'
Command_Info_Page6Content1: Do you want an auto mob killer? Do you hate people walking into your base to mine your nexus? Then turrets are the best solution! Nothing says Stay Out like a lovely skull on a fence that shoots projectiles.
Command_Info_Page6Content2: Turrets can be purchased from the nexus, thought most are rather expensive. Most turrets must be placed on top of fences. Turrets will shoot at all mobs, non-allies and non-members.
Command_Info_Page6Content3: Mines are a one-time-use defense system to deter players from entering, and careless players to get killed. Or if you just want an invader to explode just before an invasion.  Mines can ONLY BE TRIGGERED BY NON-MEMBER AND NON-ALLY PLAYERS, so mobs don't activate them. If you plan to repeatedly replace mines, then they are in no means cheap, but if an enemy was to step ona mine, it would be a sad day for that guy due to the Mine's heavy attack.
Command_Info_Page7Title: '&aPowercells'
Command_Info_Page7Content1: Don't you hate it when your enemies walk right up to your nexus to invade it? That can be solved with power cells.
Command_Info_Page7Content2: Power cells can be purchased from the nexus, and are placed similar to how nexuses are placed
Command_Info_Page7Content3: Invaders can't invade a chunk next to a chunk with a power cell. So they need to invade the land with the power cell to proceed, making the invasion more costly and time-consuming. However, power cell land does not prevent invaders from invading other power cell land. So remember this before you buy a power cell for each land you have.
Command_Info_EndingText: This is the last page of /k info, you can report bugs at https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/kingdoms-battle-for-land-might-and-glory-25-off-until-next-monday-1-7-x-1-8-x-paid.90294/ and if you still have questions, feel free to ask server staff, or fellow players.
Command_Info_Page8Title: '&aProtected Chests'
Command_Info_Page8Content1: 'Tired of players joining your kingdom...just to rob you blind and leave? Then this feature is for you! Protection signs allow your members to lock their chests! &bJust   sneak, and place a sign on the chest you want to protect, write &c&l[Protected]&b on the first line of the sign. '
Command_Info_Page8Content2: Protected chests will become unprot cted if the land they are on is unclaimed or invaded. Kings, by default, can open any protected chest in their kingdom.
